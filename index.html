          <h3>Web in 5 Years</h3>
          <p>
            Web development made a huge step forward since the web was launched and began to be available for users. There is a big improvement of its speed, functionality and graphical design. It became more user directed and last but not the least a great number of services that are provided online on both PCs and other portable devices like smartphones.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is hard to say how the web will look like in 5 years but I think a lot will continue to depend on the user needs and the creativity of the web developer. I think the more work will be done to make the web more secure (virus protected) and faster so that it will take even less time to download the web pages irrespective of how much information the web page has (text, images and video). There will be more improvement in graphical design. Better resolution and line precision, more balanced color and possibly more of the 3D effect of images and text on the web page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nowadays there are so many services available on the internet e.g. bank services, shopping, learning tutorials, social media, GPS, maps, TV online and many applications on the smart phone and devices other than PC. The amount of those services will of course grow depending on the customer needs and they will be more easy-to-use and secure so that, for example, the customer will be willing to make payments for and use more services online with no feeling of risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the progress so far, both users and the web developers are still experiencing problems with the compatibility of the web page on different web browsers and platforms. I may guess, the big improvement could happen here as well. It will either be one and only, well functional web browser be developed or all other will come to its best functionality so that the web developer would not need to think so much about the compatibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I would wish myself is that less advertisement would appear on different websites. I understand the need of it but the web page could be designed so that the advertisement will be there without visually disturbing so much the main content of the web side. Also, I wish that more improvement will be done for the websites providing direct online services for research data and statistical analysis. They could be more functional, more user friendly and faster. More information on the theory behind each test could be added to make it easier for the user to understand the choice of this or that test.
