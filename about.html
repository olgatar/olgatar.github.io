        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          Hi! My name is Olga and I am 33 years old. In 2008 I left my home country Estonia and moved to Sweden.
        </p>
          <p>
          Besides programming I have a strong passion to research. Currently, I am working as laboratory engineer/research assistant and work a lot with data analyses and statistics. So, if you need any help with that just let me know!
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time I practice mindfulness and meditation.  I would love to share my experience with you as I truly believe that compassion and being mindfully present is a cure for many illnesses and is the source to peaceful balance in life. I like to do different kind of sports and am vegetarian to keep myself healthy as long as/as much as I can. And last but not the least I love music! I play the guitar since I was 16, sing a little and even trying to create my own songs and music.
